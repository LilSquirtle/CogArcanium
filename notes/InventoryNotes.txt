Inventory Usage:
	-Honestly pretty basic right now so will run through what each script is aiming for.

In Inventory scripts group:

	-inv_init(): The initialization of the inv array and a max of how many different items it
		can hold. Has 2 args, 1st being the item number in the array and the second being either the
		item ID (0) or the amount of that item (1)
	
	-inv_data_items(): This is where the item array is initialized as well as data for all the items that
		would be within the game. 1st arg of the array is the item placement within the array,
		2nd arg is for each of the fields for that item: 
			ID = 0 : the items ID usually held within a variable in this script
			NAME = 1 : in-game name for the item
			DESC = 2 : a short description of the item
			PRICE = 3 : general price the item would have (not sure if we are using this???)
			EFFECT = 4 : effect of the item; typically statistical effects but should be usable
				if something like poison is being implemented
	
	-inv_add(item_name, amount_to_add): Pretty straight-forward, adds an item of the name given to the
		inv array of the given amount. used for item pick-ups, prizes, etc.
		
	-inv_remove(item_name, amount_to_remove): Removes an item of the name given from the inv array of
		the given amount. useful for item usage, dropping unwanted items, etc. (maybe for equiping 
		too?)
		
	-inv_show(): I was using this to test out the other methods of the inventory scripts so I imagine
		this will get changed based on the menu system in the future
		
		
In ItemUsageTesting group:
	
	-init_stats_for_testing(): Was using this so that I could test out the use_item script with just
		simple health potions so probably not too useful
			
	-use_item(item_name): Got some item usage started, only accounts for health potions right now
		though (though we don't have much items here just yet but usage for them would be added in
		the future)
		
		(I do have to note here that the variables that the health potions go by may need changed
		here in order to be useful for the actual player)
		
	-stats_show_testing(): I needed a script where i could test and see that the use_item was working
		so this should be based on the game's drawing 
		
The objects here were specifically so that I could test the actual scripts functionality so no need for
those

Pretty simple start for inventory scripts, will add to this as we hone in on what items and 
such we want in the game. If there is any optimization for these that anyone knows about that I don't
I would be glad to hear about! (inv_data_items is mainly what I'm thinking may need it cause it seems
like it will be super long with more items later)
